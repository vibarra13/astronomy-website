        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Victor Ibarra-Martinez. I started learning astronomy at a very young age 
            when I got my first telescope, and I have recently discovered that passion again. 
            I made this website to showcase my skills in front end developing using CSS and HTML, 
            and to showcase the images I have taken with camera and telescope. I'm always looking 
            to learn new things because I love to learn!
            <br><br>
            At the moment, I'm working on getting my bachelor's degree in computer science at a
            4 year university. As of December 2021 I am not in school, but being a recent community 
            college graduate with my associates degree I want to transfer to a 4 year school to
            continue my studies. I hope to build experience in astronomy and computer science
            while I'm at school, and my overall dream is to work with NASA. I can code in Python,
            Java, CSS, and HTML. 
            <br><br>I am currently working on a project that allows me to collect image data from 
            radio telescopes. I will write code that can read the data from FITS files, pixel by
            pixel, and it will determine whether there is a pulsar within that image, and it will 
            locate it on the image. I take great pride in what I do, and I hope to work with others 
            on even bigger projects.
            <br><br>
            You can reach me on my socials underneath the picture of me! Thanks for reading!
