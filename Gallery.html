            <h1>The most remarkable experience you can ever witness!</h1>
            <p>
                Hey all! It's Victor, and let me introduce my star-packed, out of this world images that will leave your jaw dropped! I'll take you through
                the endless void of space, showing you images beginning from our own solar system, and ending in other galaxies! It's the best way to get a feel for the 
                vastness of space, and I'll be super excited to share my photos with you. 
                <br><br>
                Most of these photos I took with an old DSLR camera that I bought off ebay, but it's still going strong to produce amazing images right here from Earth. By mounting 
                this camera on my telescope and mount, I'm able to reach farther into space than I ever imagined. This hobby is like time-traveling, as you're looking 
                into the past more than hundreds of thousands of years! Try to wrap that around your head when looking at these photos. Safe travels!

        <p class="conclusion">
            Now that we've toured the solar system and beyond, what can we say about space? Well, 
            based on all the images I've taken with camera and telescope, it's fair to say that
            we have no idea just how much is out there. We live relatively unbothered here on Earth, so 
            exploring space is a way to get us thinking... and what better way to explore it than 
            taking some beautiful pictures to share? <br><br>
            After seeing some of these photos, do you feel like you want to go out into the night and 
            capture some yourself? It's possible, but it's a tricky process to grab some of the photos 
            I showed in this gallery. Refer to my guide on astrophotography on the learning page!
