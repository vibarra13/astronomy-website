                <h2>Introducion to Astronomy</h2>
                <h1><u>Preface</u></h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my space guide! My name is Victor Ibarra-Martinez and I am an avid astronomer,
                    and an amateur at that. This blog coded and designed by me will be a way to share my knowledge of space
                    with all the astronomers looking to expand their knowledge. Space is a huge topic, with many 
                    subtopics that can be studied. There's a lot to learn, but it's hard to pinpoint one exact thing.
                    That is why I designed this guide for anyone looking to begin their journey
                    into the depths of space. It is one of the most mysterious, yet beautiful wonders
                    of the universe since the beginning of time. Watch the video below to get
                    just a brief summary on what astronomy really is, and I will follow up with
                    you after the video is over. See you on the other side!</p>
                    <h1><u>What is astronomy?</u></h1>
                    <iframe width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XinkicMVzLs" frameborder="0"

                    <p>Definition of astronomy (taken from space.com): Astronomy is the study
                    of the sun, moon, stars, planets, comets, gas, galaxies, dust and
                    other non-Earthly bodies and phenomena.</p>
                    <p>Before anyone gets astronomy and astrology confused, I'll clear up
                    the atmosphere on the two heavily confused topics:
                    they are two separate things; <u><b>astronomy</b></u> deals with the science aspect of outer-space
                    phenomena, like using the scientific method to figure out the orbital period of a planet, 
                    and using numerical data to show how fast a comet is moving. <u><b>Astrology</b></u> involves the 
                    alignments of celestial objects (i.e. Earth, Moon, Sun, planets) among the backdrop of stars
                    and how those alignments affect our personalities, fortune, and other things.
                    They used to be closely associated for long time, until somewhere around 1100 to
                    the enlightenment era, when people began making scientific developments.
                    <br><br>Astronomy is a beautiful topic that many
                    people seem to appreciate. Those who love it look for ways to incorporate it into their 
                    careers, those who appreciate it look for ways to impress their family and peers with their 
                    knowledge about the astros.</p>
                    <h1><u>How can I start exploring the stars?</u></h1>
                    <p>If you are confused where to even start with astronomy, the best solution to that is 
                    to go out on a clear and starry night. Stargazing is an immersive way to understand the 
                    stars, and it helps you feel more motivated to learn about astronomy. After all, it 
                    is where your interest in astronomy comes from, so give it a few tries. Once you go stargazing
                    for the first time, you may notice that the night sky is filled with stars in all directions. It may
                    be helpful to take a notebook with you to write down interesting observations.
                    So how can you make the stars seem more familiar? Lucky for you, astronomers hundreds of years ago 
                    created maps of the stars, for both Northern AND Southern hemisphere observers 
                    (the stars differ in both hemispheres, with some stars showing up in both). 
                    These star maps are available for free online, and all you have to do is print 
                    one out and bring it with you on a clear night. Here is a website that you can 
                    print a star map from: <a href="http://skymaps.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">SkyMaps.com</a>
                    <br><br>Star maps have even made it to the technology world! You can download the Stellarium 
                    software: 
                    (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noctuasoftware.stellarium_free&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a>,
                    <a href="https://stellarium-mobile-sky-map.en.softonic.com/iphone" target="_blank">Apple</a>,
                    <a href="http://stellarium.org/" target="_blank">PC/Mac/Linux</a>) that serves the same functions as paper star maps,
                    but they are much more interactive after a quick calibration of the night sky. Personally, I recommend
                    this over using a printed star map, plus you will save paper!
                    <br><br>Using these helpful tools, you can familiarize yourself with ancient star patterns known as 
                    constellations, stars, planets, the lunar cycle, the seasons, comets, asteroids, the sun, galaxies, and much more.
                    There are a lot of topics to study that are astronomy-based, and the more you learn about one topic,
                    the more you realize that you don't understand. That is the beauty of astronomy, and it
                    sparks a curiosity in those who want to keep learning.</p>
                    <h1><u>What topic would be fit for me?</u></h1>
                    <p>After spending time looking into outer space, what did you find interesting? Did anything in particular
                    stick out more than other things? This is where the notes you wrote might come in handy, as 
                    they can help provide an insight into what you like to observe most. For me personally, it was the nebulae.
                    They stick out to me because they are colorful monstrosities, the death and birth of stars.
                    They are a part of deep space, which is the part of space beyond our solar system. 
                    I find it interesting because there is so much to be explored, and so much to be found. I love that aspect 
                    because I get to observe with my own telescope and imagine what's out there.
                    <br><br>Your own observations may lead you to like the planets, and if we can find planets 
                    similar to Earth in deep space, or you may enjoy just looking up at the stars and noticing every
                    few hours how they move, in that case you may find interest in the movements of celestial objects.
                    There is a lot to figure out, and this is the most important part of your journey in the field of astronomy.

                <h2>Different Kinds of Astronomy</h2>
                <h3>Astronomy is broken down into a number of subfields, allowing scientists
                    to specialize in particular objects and phenomena:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Planetary astronomers (also called planetary scientists) focus on the 
                        growth, evolution, and death of planets. While most study the worlds 
                        inside the solar system, some use the growing body of evidence about 
                        planets around other stars to hypothesize what they might be like. 
                        According to the University College London, planetary science "is a 
                        cross-discipline field including aspects of astronomy, atmospheric 
                        science, geology, space physics, biology and chemistry."</li>
                    <li>Stellar astronomers turn their eyes to the stars, including the black
                        holes, nebulae, white dwarfs and supernova that survive stellar deaths.
                        The University of California, Los Angeles, says, "The focus of stellar
                        astronomy is on the physical and chemical processes that occur in 
                        the universe."</li>
                    <li>Solar astronomers spend their time analyzing a single star — our sun.
                        According to NASA, "The quantity and quality of light from the sun 
                        varies on time scales from milli-seconds to billions of years." 
                        Understanding those changes can help scientists recognize how Earth
                        is affected. The sun also helps us to understand how other stars work,
                        as it is the only star close enough to reveal details about its 
                        surface.</li>
                    <li>Galactic astronomers study our galaxy, the Milky Way, while 
                        extragalactic astronomers peer outside of it to determine how these
                        collections of stars form, change, and die. The University of 
                        Wisconsin-Madison says, "Establishing patterns in the distribution,
                        composition, and physical conditions of stars and gas traces the history
                        of our evolving home galaxy."</li>
                    <li>Astrometry, the most ancient branch of astronomy, is the measure of the 
                        sun, moon and planets. The precise calculations of these motions allows 
                        astronomers in other fields to model the birth and evolution of planets 
                        and stars, and to predict events such as eclipses meteor showers, and the 
                        appearance of comets. According to the Planetary Society, "Astrometry is 
                        the oldest method used to detect extrasolar planets," though it remains 
                        a difficult process.</li>
                    <li>Cosmologists focus on the universe in its entirety, from its violent birth
                        in the Big Bang to its present evolution, all the way to its eventual death.
                        Astronomy is often (not always) about very concrete, observable things, 
                        whereas cosmology typically involves large-scale properties of the universe 
                        and esoteric, invisible and sometimes purely theoretical things like string 
                        theory, dark matter and dark energy, and the notion of multiple universes.</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        These are just a few of the many studies, but they're a good place to get started.
                        For me, the best fit would be stellar astronomy because I like to observe the stars,
                        nebulae, and would absolutely love to observe the movement of stars around a black hole.
                        It may take some time to figure out what you like, but it is worth the wait! 
                        There is no exact time you have to figure it out, but learning more about outer space 
                        will better prepare you to learn whatever you want.
                        <br><br>
                        Now that you have a little bit of knowledge (and hopefully practice) from stargazing,
                        everything will feel more natural when observing. You'll start to memorize constellations 
                        and stars, the movement of the planets year-round, and what things are visible 
                        during different months of the year.

            <h2>Optical Instruments</h2>
            <p>Astronomy for long has marveled us puny humans. How is it that we know so much 
            (yet so little) about it? Optical devices such as telescopes have aided the exploration
            of space with its magnifying capability by making far away objects appear closer.
            Optical instruments include binoculars, telescopes, spectrometers, and more, and they allow us
            to dive into the stars in greater detail. They are essential to the exploration of space because of
            their light gathering capabilities able to resolve even the faintest of galaxies, all with the 
            intent to give us a deeper understanding of space. <br><br>
            Think about them like this: your eyes act as lenses (like a telescope lens). The only problem with your eyes
            is that their aperture (the diameter of the lens) is much too small to gather enough light to see deep space objects
            such as nebulae, galaxies, and others. The focal length of your eyes (the distance from the lens of your eye to
            the point of focus) is also small, which is why we have wide field vision. Both these things play a big role
            in telescopes and binoculars. The bigger the aperture, the more light gathering capabilities of a telescope.
            The higher the focal length, the more close up image you can achieve with a telescope. <br><br>
            If you're looking to get one of these instruments, I recommend getting binoculars or 
            a cheap refractor/reflector telescope to start off. These instruments give motivation to go
            out every clear night to magnify the stars, and they are a great learning experience.
            Below is a photo of my reflector telescope that helps me see the moon, planets, and stars closer up,
            and next to it a photo of binoculars.

            <h1><u>Binoculars</u></h1>
            <p>Binoculars are a small optical device that can be used in different ways, not just for our night sky.
                This tool acts like a telescope, but it can be used with both eyes. It brings the field of view closer to you,
                and it makes faint things appear a bit brighter. That is because the larger aperture brings in more light, and
                the focal length makes things appear closer. They are a very portable tool that require little setup time with a tripod
                and zero setup time without a tripod. Many people take binoculars with them on camping trips because they're great
                both in the daytime and nighttime. <br><br>I will not list pros or cons of binoculars because they are not comparable to
                telescopes. They are in their own category, they have their specific uses, and they are typically not expensive.
            </p>
            <h1><u>Telescopes</u></h1>
            <p>Telescopes are the other optical devices used by astronomers. Telescopes typically have an optical tube assembly (OTA)
                that contains an objective mirror and an eyepiece, among other things. There are many kinds of telescopes on the market,
                and I will quickly break down each one in this article.
            </p>
            <h1><u>Refractor Telescope</u></h1>
            <figure>
                <img src="resources/refractor_telescope.jfif" class="refractor" alt="A diagram of a refractor telescope: An objective lens lets light pass through,
                 focusing the light at a point that allows the human pupil to see the object magnified.">
                <figcaption>Refractor Diagram</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The refractor telescope, shown above, is a kind of telescope that lets light pass through an objective lens, which in turn bends an
            object's rays of light into focus. It then comes out the other end, called the eyepiece, and projects the image of whatever object the
            telescope is pointed at. These telescopes are typically smaller and more compact than the other kinds, making them easier to
            transport. <br><br>Pros of the refractor:</p>
            <h3><u>Pros</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically lightweight, more compact and easy to carry around or put into a travel case</li>
                <li>Does not require a large mount to operate, and easy to balance on a mount.</li>
                <li>Easy to point the scope at an object and find it quickly</li>
                <li>From a dark sky site, they provide excellent views of bright nebulae and stars</li>
                <li>Great for astrophotography, given the right one is bought for your liking.</li>
                <li>Does not require collimation (fine tuning of the lens to provide sharp views)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><u>Cons</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Suffers from chromatic aberration, an optical effect which makes objects appear hazy and purple, due to 
                the red, green, and blue wavelengths not aligning at the pupil. Affects single lens refractors the most, although
                there are Apochromatic refractors which use multiple lenses to counteract this problem.</li>
                <li>Higher quality means much higher cost, so an apochromatic is almost double or triple the price of a standard
                refractor.</li>
            </ul>
           <h1><u>Reflector Telescope</u></h1>
           <figure>
               <img src="resources/reflector_diagram.jpg" class="reflector" alt="A diagram of a reflector telescope. A large primary mirror sits at the back of
               the telescope tube, which then reflects the incoming light to a secondary mirror, back into the eyepiece, projecting the image
               onto the pupil.">
