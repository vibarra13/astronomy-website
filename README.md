Welcome to my website! This is where I have some of my info, and my creation of a website in HTML and CSS. 

Extensions of the website:
- <a href="AstronomyHomePage.html>Home page</a>
- Gallery (includes pictures of my lovely girlfriend as well as my astrophotography)
- About me page: some fun facts about me and includes my social media.

Things I have learned while making this website:
- HTML workflow
- Organization of bodies, headers, sections, etc.
- Making readable code
- Incorporating multimedia files
- Positioning of elements
- Designing elements
- Lists
- Navigation links
- CSS styling
- Wrapping
