In this repository I have a website that I've been styling and coding since summer 2020. Line by line, I have gone through many tweaks and changes to create the website
associated with this repository. It may seem a bit "colorful", emphasis on the quotes, but the way it came out is just the way my mind was thinking of when I brainstormed
the looks of the website. I think it has some character to it, and hopefully the design doesn't take away too much from the content. Enjoy!
